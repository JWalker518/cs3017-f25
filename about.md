# James Walker
Hello all fine people. As you can already tell, my name is James Walker, son of James Walker Jr. but I'm not James Walker III. To give a little background of my life, I grew up in the clean and rural area of New York City. While growing up, I had all sorts of access to farm animals such as rats and opossums, so you can say I'm a sort of animal whisperer! You can catch me back home playing on my banjo and soaking up the rays near my local lake called "The Atlantic Ocean!" Hope to see you around!

## My Hobbies
As I said before, I love to relax on my lake's beach and host bonfires with friends! Though the cops may try to stop us, we know our way around the law, so they just let us off with a warning.... Some other things I love to do involve playing video games- I'm a sort of connoisseur when it comes to those digital delights! I'm also a huge fan of Mario, so the best way to my heart would be buying me the newest Mario game. I guess another hobby of my is hair care- as you may know if you've seen me around campus, combing my hair consistently. Now, I'd like to imagine I know what I'm doing with regards to hair stuff, but after 10 years of still messing my hair up- I don't think I do!

My Hobbies:
+ Relax at the beach and have bonfires with friends.
+ Playing video games, specifically Mario.
+ Mess around with my hair.
